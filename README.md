# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The purpose of this analysis is to build an employee database providing information that will aid in the development of retiring packages for Pewlett Hackard employees & anticipate filling future positions. We have built this database by transitioning employee data from CSV files to SQL.

## Results: Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
After observing our database illustrating the Number of Retiring Employees by Title, we see that:
* Our greatest anticipated loss of employees will be our Senior Engineers & general Senior Staff due to age-out retirement.  
* Deaprtment heads should begin to consider trainings & requirments for promotions in each department so that younger employees may have the opportunity to reach senior level positions if qualified.

After observing our Mentorship Eligibility database, we see that:
* Almost 1,550 Pewlett Hackard employees are eligible for retirement.
* We have 60 employees with potential errors on thier employment duration. If not errors, these employees of retiring age have began employment after Januray 1st of 1999.

## Summary: Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
* How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
* Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
