# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of this analysis is to build an employee database providing information that will aid in the development of retiring packages for Pewlett Hackard employees & anticipate filling future positions. We have built this database by transitioning employee data from CSV files to SQL.

## Results:
After observing our database illustrating the Number of Retiring Employees by Title, we see that:
* Our greatest anticipated loss of employees will be our Senior Engineers & general Senior Staff due to age-out retirement.  
* Deaprtment heads should begin to consider trainings & requirments for promotions in each department so that younger employees may have the opportunity to reach senior level positions if qualified.

After observing our Mentorship Eligibility database, we see that:
* Almost 1,550 Pewlett Hackard employees are eligible for retirement.
* We have 60 employees with potential errors on thier employment duration. If not errors, these employees of retiring age have began employment after Januray 1st of 1999.

## Summary:
As we can see from our "Retiring Titles" database, we are expected to fill 72,458 roles within the company, due to the "Silver Tsunami".

Based on our Retiring Titles & Mentorship Eligibility databases, we do have enough qualified employees to begin mentonship for next generation employees, but it should be noted that based on our Manager Info database (pictured below), there is an extremely low number of Managers per department. There should be an increased focus in Mentorship for Managerial level roles in order to increase count of employee qualified for Senior level positions.
